# Data_Cleaning_process
# Melbourne Housing - Data Cleaning Project

## Project Overview

This project is focused on cleaning the **Melbourne Housing Dataset** from Kaggle, which contains property sales data across Melbourne, Australia.  
The dataset includes information on property type, price, size, location, and sale dates with **13,580 rows and 21 columns** in its original form.

The goal of this project was to transform the raw dataset into an analysis-ready format by:
- Identifying and handling missing values
- Removing irrelevant and duplicate records
- Detecting and treating outliers
- Correcting data inconsistencies and invalid values
- Validating data integrity
- Documenting the cleaning process

---

## Key Tasks Performed

### Missing Value Handling
- Filled or removed missing values in:
  - `Price`: Dropped rows with missing values
  - `BuildingArea` and `YearBuilt`: Replaced with median values
  - `CouncilArea`: Filled with mode (most frequent value)

### Duplicate & Outlier Removal
- Removed duplicate records
- Treated outliers in:
  - `Price` using IQR method (removed extreme values above 99th percentile)

### Inconsistency Fixes
- Converted `Date` column to proper datetime format
- Verified valid property types: `h` (house), `u` (unit), `t` (townhouse)
- Removed irrelevant columns: `Address`, `SellerG`, `Postcode`

### Feature Engineering
- `property_age` = year of sale - `YearBuilt`
- `land_price_ratio` = `Price` รท `Landsize`

### Validation
- Ensured all numeric fields (`Rooms`, `Price`, `BuildingArea`) had valid positive values
- Checked that all dates fell within valid ranges
- Verified categorical data consistency for `Type` and `CouncilArea`
